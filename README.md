Trivia Game

This is a trivia game based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  It is a short 5 question game built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery that could be easilly scaleable to add more questions. Utilizing JQuery I was able to manipulate the DOM in a number of ways to make the game feel more interactive.  The page is fully responsive using basic CSS and a simple, yet elegant layout.
